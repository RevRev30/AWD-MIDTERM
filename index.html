                    <p><strong>Watch 1 - Rolex Submariner</strong></p>
                    <p>As an underwater survival tool, this watch’s design has been entirely dictated by the practical needs
                        of divers. Since 1953, the Submariner has evolved technically and aesthetically as it has been endowed
                        with features to improve overall functionality. The first watch was a pioneer and its subsequent
                        versions have continued to set the benchmark for divers’ watches.</p>
